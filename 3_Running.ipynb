    "The `in-port-rename` subcommand allows you to remap the identity of a smartnic platform physical ingress port to any logical port as seen by the user logic.  Once remapped (eg. from `a`->`b`), all following logic in the smartnic will perceive that the packet arrived on ingress port `b` even though it physically arrived on port `a`.  This can be useful for test injection scenarios but would typically be set to a straight-through mapping in production.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `in-port-connect` subcommand allows you to connect a logical input port to different processing pipelines within the smartnic.

    "##### Override user application output port decisions and redirect to an alternate port\n",
    "\n",
    "The `app0-port-redirect` and `app1-port-redirect` subcommands allow the user to override the forwarding decisions made by the user application and/or p4 program and redirect any given output port to a different output port.  This can be useful during development/debugging and in test fixtures.\n",
